  bio: A young tech professional from the beautiful British Columbia who likes to spend his time exploring the wast amount of the data readily available through the world. My hobby, if not diving or skiing is to learn novel Machine Learning techniques and use them to discover new insights and patterns in data. This blog mostly includes snippets from my thoughs and python code that might perhaps helps someone else doing the same.
  
  There is always something new to learn!
